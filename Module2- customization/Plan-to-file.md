## Understanding Terraform Plan-to-File

**Your understanding is correct!**

Here's a simplified explanation:

### What is Terraform Plan-to-File?
* **Creating a Blueprint:** When you run `terraform plan`, Terraform creates a detailed blueprint of the changes it would make to your infrastructure. 
* **Saving the Blueprint:** The `-out-file` option lets you save this blueprint as a file (like `infra.plan`).
* **Applying the Blueprint:** Later, you can use this saved plan to make the exact same changes to another environment (like production) by running `terraform apply infra.plan`.

### Why is it Useful?
* **Consistency:** Ensures the same changes are applied to different environments.
* **Efficiency:** Avoids re-running the plan in each environment.
* **Safety:** Allows for careful review of the plan before applying it to production.

**In essence:** You're creating a reliable recipe for infrastructure changes and applying it consistently.
